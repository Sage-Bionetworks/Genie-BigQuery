# Genie-BigQuery

This resource is only available for AACR GENIE consortium members only!

This repository will contain the BigQuery scripts that are used to analyze the GENIE data.  Please view the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to add to this repository.

## Usage

Google's permission model allows for those that have BigQuery User access to a BigQuery project to query all publically available data.  We are utilizing the 1TB free query resource every month to provide this free as a free resource to GENIE consortium members.  Due to this, please only use the GENIE BigQuery project code for queries on the tables within the GENIE BigQuery project. For queries against other datasets, the user should supply their own project code so that those queries are billed to the user, not GENIE.
